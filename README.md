# My HTML + CSS Project
 This is a repository to all my classwork exercises and related assignments in my journey to learn more about HTML and CSS 
My name is Job Otieno and I've just turned a leaf in my journey to learn more about coding
This repository contains all outcomes to assigned exercises and related assignments as I embark on learning more about HTML and CSS
I'm also getting to know why it's important to provide as much information as possible regarding an application/project that anyone else who whould like to contribute to it doesn't have to struggle with information gaps.
Welcome to my journey
